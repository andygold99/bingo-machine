#Bingo Machine

##What is Bingo Machine?

Bingo Machine is a more social experience for Online Bingo (The Virtual kind!). People will be able to play via the Web, Facebook, iOS and Android all at the same time. Create and control your own Bingo rooms, run them how you like and meet and chat to lots of great people. That's the vision, lets make it happen.

##Getting started

###Prerequisites
* You will need a license for impact.js costing $99 http://impactjs.com/buy-impact
* Asset resources for images and sound
* A https://firebase.com database

> *Contact @andygold99 for asset resources*

###Setting up

Once you have cloned your forked repo, open up `bingo-machine/lib/game/bm.js` and amend the firebaseRoot to point to your firebase database.

The asset resources media folder when you get one, needs to go in the root of `bingo-machine`.

Thanks
